# NMP - No Mouse Password generator

I don't like to use the mouse, I will do anything to avoid to take my hands out of the typing position. 

When comes to password generators there's always a button you have to click somewhere to generate what you want.

So I created this app that allows me to generate passwords without having to click on anything, all I have to do is to input a simple syntax that is going to be interpreted by an algorithm and give a password as an output.

I think the result was good, maybe once I learn enough react I can try to rewrite using the framework, I even got a domain for it, check it out, there's instructions on the website
